# Lazy Input, the world is this Simple!
Lazy input is a utility app for controlling the computer using a mobile device.
The controlled computer and the controlling device need to be connected to the same WIFI network.
No need to install any mobile app, everything happens between the lazy input server on your computer and a browser on your mobile device.

2. Connect the computer and the mobile device onto the same WIFI network.
3. From the directory where you put the unzipped folder, run the lazy input server.
